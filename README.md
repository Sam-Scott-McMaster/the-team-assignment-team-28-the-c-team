# SpendFlow

SpendFlow is an app built in C to allow users to easily manage their spending
and create a simple budget to follow.

## Program Style

SpendFlow utilizes the terminal window to create a GUI like interface with
text, creating a mini "phone" screen for the user to interact with.

SpendFlow also uses clever printing methods to create dynamic loading animations.

## Menus

When you first open the app, you are greeted by a sign-in / up menu. From here, you
can get into your account.

Next, you can either update your bank balance, manage transactions, or manage budget.
