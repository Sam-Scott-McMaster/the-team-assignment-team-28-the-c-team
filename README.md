# SpendFlow

SpendFlow is an app built in C to allow users to easily manage their spending
and create a simple budget to follow.

## Program Style

SpendFlow utilizes the terminal window to create a GUI like interface with
text, creating a mini "phone" screen for the user to interact with.

SpendFlow also uses clever printing methods to create dynamic loading animations.
